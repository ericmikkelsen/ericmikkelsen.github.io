<h2 id="tribune-content-agency">Tribune Content Agency</h2>
<p>While I was at Tribune Publishing this was my first real big project. I got to build a massive site, that would hold tons of content, use several custom post types and custom taxonomies. There&#x27;s stuff that&#x27;s weird about how I handled stuff, but I think mostly the site still holds up from a development perspective.</p>
<h2 id="stuff-i-m-still-proud-of-to-this-day">Stuff I&#x27;m still proud of to this day</h2>
<p>I was obcessed with the critical rendering path, and to this day, it still to interactive in under 3 seconds on 3g. The one trick I did, which I still haven&#x27;t done since (but will now that I remember), was break up the stylesheets into different media queries. This was a not super awesome authoring experience, but it did prevent render blocking from those styles. Reducing the blocking styles to a stylesheet that wasn&#x27;t even 14kb.</p>
<p>Because this was an agency, and I was kind of left to myself I got to set any kind of development standards I wanted. So I used that power responsibly and tried to make sure the site worked well in Opera Mini. It&#x27;s not perfect, but alot of the interactions have fallbacks that allow you to access the same content.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-d-change-or-update">What I&#x27;d Change or update</h2>
<ol>
<li>This was before I ever worked with a build step, at this point, I&#x27;d probably handle that media query trick with gulp or post css or something.</li>
<li>I&#x27;d probably redo the site in AMP, there&#x27;s no interaction that is super complex, so moving to AMP would be fairly easy. And Amp was literally built for this.</li>
<li>I didn&#x27;t know much about Accessibilty back then, so I&#x27;d go back and audit the site for A11Y issues.</li>
