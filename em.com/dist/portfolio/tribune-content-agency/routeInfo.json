I got to build a massive site, that would hold tons of content, use several custom post types and custom taxonomies. There&#39;s stuff that&#39;s weird about how I handled stuff, but I think mostly the site still holds up from a development perspective.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stuff-i-m-still-proud-of-to-this-day\">Stuff I&#39;m still proud of to this day</h2>\n<p>I was obcessed with the critical rendering path, and to this day, it still to interactive in under 3 seconds on 3g. The one trick I did, which I still haven&#39;t done since (but will now that I remember), was break up the stylesheets into different media queries. This was a not super awesome authoring experience, but it did prevent render blocking from those styles. Reducing the blocking styles to a stylesheet that wasn&#39;t even 14kb.</p>\n<p>Because this was an agency, and I was kind of left to myself I got to set any kind of development standards I wanted. So I used that power responsibly and tried to make sure the site worked well in Opera Mini. It&#39;s not perfect, but alot of the interactions have fallbacks that allow you to access the same content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-d-change-or-update\">What I&#39;d Change or update</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>This was before I ever worked with a build step, at this point, I&#39;d probably handle that media query trick with gulp or post css or something.</li>\n<li>I&#39;d probably redo the site in AMP, there&#39;s no interaction that is super complex, so moving to AMP would be fairly easy. And Amp was literally built for this.</li>\n<li>I didn&#39;t know much about Accessibilty back then, so I&#39;d go back and audit the site for A11Y issues.</li>\n</ol>\n"}}}
