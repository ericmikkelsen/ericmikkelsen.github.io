I get on the plane, I open my laptop, and I go to the internet and I don&#39;t have access, so I bare down and click the Itunes logo, and wait 5 minutes. for it to catalogue all the music I have on my machine. The christmas mixes I&#39;ve made my mom between now and the last time I opened Itunes, the memes, the fart noises I send to my wife in emails. Everything. It&#39;s the worst. I just want Winamp basically. I want a simple thing I could open up and add some songs, and get rolling. And I wanted it in a browser, because the web is the best platform.</p>\n<h2 id="why-make-stuff-">Why make stuff?</h2>\n<p>Radio house came from a desire to have an app that plays my local music. Also, since I wanted to move into doing more app development, it was a chance to learn React in a reasonable way.</p>\n<p>My goals were:</p>\n<h3 id="to-learn-react-">To Learn React.</h3>\n<p>At some point I became a marketing developer, which from my point of view seems light years away from front end developer, but when you talk to regular human being, they&#39;re like &quot;So you make web stuff, but not that web stuff?&quot; It actually seems reasonably close. So this is one of a few projects I&#39;ll be working on to cut my teeth on React and Webpack and PWAs etc.</p>\n<h3 id="statically-render-as-much-as-possible-">Statically render as much as possible.</h3>\n<p>As performance goes, nothing takes up megabytes on the internet like images and video, but nothing takes up processing power like Javascript. So that meant I wanted first render to have as much legitimate content rendered. I settled on using Next.js to pre-render static React (or in my case Preact) and hosted it on Netlify.</p>\n<h3 id="focus-on-accessibility-and-beauty-">Focus on accessibility and beauty.</h3>\n<p>I have this thing stuck in my craw, This notion that making accessible sites is an ugly venture just irritates my jib. So on this project I wanted to focus on Accessibility and Beauty. The whole thing uses semantic focusable markup, and doesn&#39;t do weird stuff with focus etc. But also I effort into making big beautiful readable high contrast text. About every week I change the colors, because I get bored easily, but big spaced out well structured text just looks good when you do it right.</p>\n<h2 id="stuff-i-want-to-change-or-build-still-">Stuff I want to change or build still.</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The whole point is offline support, so a service worker at some point so it can work offline</li>\n<li>Remembering previous tracks added</li>\n<li>Album + Artist Views</li>\n<li>Stretch goal is see if I can use some WASM library to rip cds. Probably not though.</li>\n</ol>\n'},{'excerpt':'Adapt is Sprout Social\'s new "Big Thinking" blog, that required a fork of our pattern library, and was my first project built from scratch using tachyons, a utility class library.','image':'/images/portfolio/adapt.png','image-featured':'/images/portfolio/adapt-featured.png','layout':'Page','permalink':'adapt','title':'Adapt by Sprout Social','breadcrumbs':[{'url':'/','text':'home'},{'url':'/portfolio','text':'portfolio'},{'text':'adapt'}],'contents':'<p>Sprout Social&#39;s big thinking blog. <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/adapt">link</a></p>\n<h2 id="the-technologies-we-used-">The Technologies we used:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CSS</li>\n<li>HTML</li>\n<li>Javascript</li>\n<li>PHP</li>\n<li>SCSS</li>\n<li>Twig Templating</li>\n<li>Wordpress</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="sprout-wants-to-be-a-good-company-not-just-a-good-social-media-company-">Sprout wants to be a good company, not just a good social media company.</h2>\n<p>Adapt was the new big thinking blog at Sprout Social, it&#39;s purpose was to write articles that talked more about how to run a great company and be a leader, as opposed to their other blog Insights who&#39;s goal was to lead the conversation in Social Media Management.</p>\n<h2 id="from-a-technical-standpoint-">From a technical Standpoint . . .</h2>\n<p>. . . it was interesting, we had a pattern library, which could be evolved to a new look with just a few variable changes in our scss. We had recently moved from a straight up pattern library, to a much looser pattern library that used mostly utility classes. but this was the first time we went whole hog on utility classes, which proved to make things much easier actually, we had to change the default color of links a few other brand decisions, but most of what was happening was just new components being built out of the utilities and being saved in twig templates.  It was pretty great. </p>\n<h3 id="don-t-mess-with-the-wordpress-loop-">Don&#39;t mess with the Wordpress loop.</h3>\n<p>I mean, mess with it alot, it&#39;s super powerful, and I&#39;ve done it a ton, but this one thing . . . Oh man, having 9 posts on one page of an archive, and 8 on another, is not a thing that Wordpress likes to do. But I did it, and then built a class around it, so we never ever had to fix that one problem ever again.</p>\n<h2 id="i-m-crazy-happy-that-adapt-is-accessible-and-beautiful-">I&#39;m crazy happy that adapt is accessible and beautiful.</h2>\n<p>At this point I had helped build the Accessibility Guild, and the design department was on board. They picked a deep dark purple for links, and on articles all links had underlines. There&#39;s little things I could pick on, but for the most part, it as bold, easy to read, and beautiful.

So that Yoast could use .png files, and the content could serve SVGs. The idea was to have a node service living on Lambda, or use a Cloudinary or something.

I got to build a massive site, that would hold tons of content, use several custom post types and custom taxonomies. There&#39;s stuff that&#39;s weird about how I handled stuff, but I think mostly the site still holds up from a development perspective.</p>\n<h2 id="stuff-i-m-still-proud-of-to-this-day">Stuff I&#39;m still proud of to this day</h2>\n<p>I was obcessed with the critical rendering path, and to this day, it still to interactive in under 3 seconds on 3g. The one trick I did, which I still haven&#39;t done since (but will now that I remember), was break up the stylesheets into different media queries. This was a not super awesome authoring experience, but it did prevent render blocking from those styles. Reducing the blocking styles to a stylesheet that wasn&#39;t even 14kb.</p>\n<p>Because this was an agency, and I was kind of left to myself I got to set any kind of development standards I wanted. So I used that power responsibly and tried to make sure the site worked well in Opera Mini. It&#39;s not perfect, but alot of the interactions have fallbacks that allow you to access the same content.</p>\n<h2 id="what-i-d-change-or-update">What I&#39;d Change or update</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>This was before I ever worked with a build step, at this point, I&#39;d probably handle that media query trick with gulp or post css or something.</li>\n<li>I&#39;d probably redo the site in AMP, there&#39;s no interaction that is super complex, so moving to AMP would be fairly easy. And Amp was literally built for this.</li>\n<li>I didn&#39;t know much about Accessibilty back then, so I&#39;d go back and audit the site for A11Y issues.</li>\n</ol>\n'}],'breadcrumbs':[{'url':'/','text':'home'},{'text':'portfolio'}]},'siteData':{'title':'React Static'}};</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://www.ericmikkelsen.com/bootstrap.c2740d13.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://www.ericmikkelsen.com/templates/src/containers/Archive.6b515e00.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://www.ericmikkelsen.com/main.376c9d69.js"></script></body></html>
