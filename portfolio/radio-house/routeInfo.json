I get on the plane, I open my laptop, and I go to the internet and I don&#39;t have access, so I bare down and click the Itunes logo, and wait 5 minutes. for it to catalogue all the music I have on my machine. The christmas mixes I&#39;ve made my mom between now and the last time I opened Itunes, the memes, the fart noises I send to my wife in emails. Everything. It&#39;s the worst. I just want Winamp basically. I want a simple thing I could open up and add some songs, and get rolling. And I wanted it in a browser, because the web is the best platform.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-make-stuff-\">Why make stuff?</h2>\n<p>Radio house came from a desire to have an app that plays my local music. Also, since I wanted to move into doing more app development, it was a chance to learn React in a reasonable way.</p>\n<p>My goals were:</p>\n<h3 id=\"to-learn-react-\">To Learn React.</h3>\n<p>At some point I became a marketing developer, which from my point of view seems light years away from front end developer, but when you talk to regular human being, they&#39;re like &quot;So you make web stuff, but not that web stuff?&quot; It actually seems reasonably close. So this is one of a few projects I&#39;ll be working on to cut my teeth on React and Webpack and PWAs etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"statically-render-as-much-as-possible-\">Statically render as much as possible.</h3>\n<p>As performance goes, nothing takes up megabytes on the internet like images and video, but nothing takes up processing power like Javascript. So that meant I wanted first render to have as much legitimate content rendered. I settled on using Next.js to pre-render static React (or in my case Preact) and hosted it on Netlify.</p>\n<h3 id=\"focus-on-accessibility-and-beauty-\">Focus on accessibility and beauty.</h3>\n<p>I have this thing stuck in my craw, This notion that making accessible sites is an ugly venture just irritates my jib. So on this project I wanted to focus on Accessibility and Beauty. The whole thing uses semantic focusable markup, and doesn&#39;t do weird stuff with focus etc. But also I effort into making big beautiful readable high contrast text. About every week I change the colors, because I get bored easily, but big spaced out well structured text just looks good when you do it right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stuff-i-want-to-change-or-build-still-\">Stuff I want to change or build still.</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The whole point is offline support, so a service worker at some point so it can work offline</li>\n<li>Remembering previous tracks added</li>\n<li>Album + Artist Views</li>\n<li>Stretch goal is see if I can use some WASM library to rip cds. Probably not though.</li>\n</ol>\n"}}}
