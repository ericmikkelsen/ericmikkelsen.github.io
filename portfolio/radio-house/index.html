<h2 id="my-problem-with-the-internet-planes-and-music-">My problem with the internet, planes, and music.</h2>
<p>Every single time I take a trip on a plane I&#x27;m stuck doing a thing I despise. I get on the plane, I open my laptop, and I go to the internet and I don&#x27;t have access, so I bare down and click the Itunes logo, and wait 5 minutes. for it to catalogue all the music I have on my machine. The christmas mixes I&#x27;ve made my mom between now and the last time I opened Itunes, the memes, the fart noises I send to my wife in emails. Everything. It&#x27;s the worst. I just want Winamp basically. I want a simple thing I could open up and add some songs, and get rolling. And I wanted it in a browser, because the web is the best platform.</p>
<h2 id="why-make-stuff-">Why make stuff?</h2>
<p>Radio house came from a desire to have an app that plays my local music. Also, since I wanted to move into doing more app development, it was a chance to learn React in a reasonable way.</p>
<p>My goals were:</p>
<h3 id="to-learn-react-">To Learn React.</h3>
<p>At some point I became a marketing developer, which from my point of view seems light years away from front end developer, but when you talk to regular human being, they&#x27;re like &quot;So you make web stuff, but not that web stuff?&quot; It actually seems reasonably close. So this is one of a few projects I&#x27;ll be working on to cut my teeth on React and Webpack and PWAs etc.</p>
<h3 id="statically-render-as-much-as-possible-">Statically render as much as possible.</h3>
<p>As performance goes, nothing takes up megabytes on the internet like images and video, but nothing takes up processing power like Javascript. So that meant I wanted first render to have as much legitimate content rendered. I settled on using Next.js to pre-render static React (or in my case Preact) and hosted it on Netlify.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-accessibility-and-beauty-">Focus on accessibility and beauty.</h3>
<p>I have this thing stuck in my craw, This notion that making accessible sites is an ugly venture just irritates my jib. So on this project I wanted to focus on Accessibility and Beauty. The whole thing uses semantic focusable markup, and doesn&#x27;t do weird stuff with focus etc. But also I effort into making big beautiful readable high contrast text. About every week I change the colors, because I get bored easily, but big spaced out well structured text just looks good when you do it right.</p>
<h2 id="stuff-i-want-to-change-or-build-still-">Stuff I want to change or build still.</h2>
<ol>
<li>The whole point is offline support, so a service worker at some point so it can work offline</li>
<li>Remembering previous tracks added</li>
<li>Album + Artist Views</li>
<li>Stretch goal is see if I can use some WASM library to rip cds. Probably not though.</li>
