I made a few twists and turns in college, as people do, from Graphic Designer to Animator to Web Designer to UX expert to Web Developer to Web Designer/Developer. As a result, the websites I build reflect all of these skills and sensibilities.

I’m as focused on performance as I am design - I put as much thought into what emotions a typeface evokes, as I do into the speed at which that type gets sent over the wire.

### I Love to be . . .
Designing in the browser, Specifically designing atoms, molecules, layouts, templates etc, and working towards a style guide that’s a handoff to clients or used internally.

### I can be . . .
Your web designer, frontend developer, php/wordpress backend developer, css expert.
