I made a few twists and turns in college, as people do, from Graphic Designer to Animator to Web Designer to UX expert to Web Developer to Web Designer/Developer. As a result, the websites I build reflect all of these skills and sensibilities.

### I love to . . .
Design in the browser, play with type, worry constantly about performance, think about the critical rendering path, and make websites that are crazy fast.

### I can be . . .
Your web designer, frontend developer, PHP developer, new CSS stuff expert, HTML prep chef, SVG editor, Accessibility advocate, or only person who cares about Opera Mini.

### For fun I . . .
Make pizza, walk a pug named Spock, and bike all over.
